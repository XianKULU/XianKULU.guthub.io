I am currently a researcher at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) under the supervision of [Prof. Lik-Hang Lee](https://www.lhlee.com/). Prior to that, I received a M.Phil. research degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in the Division of Artificial Intelligence (AI), under the supervision of [Prof. Pan HUI](https://panhui.people.ust.hk/) and [Prof. Mingming Fan](https://www.mingmingfan.com/). Before I came to Hong Kong, I worked in the X-HCI lab at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University in Suzhou under the supervision of [Prof. Haining Liang](https://cma.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-regular/hai-ning-liang/).

The research areas I am interested in are human-computer interaction, virtual reality, collaboration and haptics, and you can find all my published articles at [publications page]() and my current work in progress at [projects page](). If you are interested in my research, you can contact me by email.
